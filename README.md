# PngComponents2

Provides TPngSpeedButton2 and TPngBitBtn2 (VCL) as an extension to the original PngComponents. 
(This means this package requires the [PngComponents](http://cc.embarcadero.com/item/26127) suite)

Has more properties such as 
* Overlay image, 
* extended Options property (pngBlendOnEnabled, pngGrayscaleOnEnabled, pngBlendNotHovering, pngGrayscaleNotHovering) and 
* advanced Windows Theming.

Here is a screen shot of the Object Inspector where the new properies are highlighted:
